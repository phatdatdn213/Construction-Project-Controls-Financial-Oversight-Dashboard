## 📌 Executive Summary
This repository contains an end-to-end analytics project designed to simulate the **Project Controls** and **Operational Excellence** standards at a global consultancy (e.g., **Turner & Townsend**). 

The project transforms fragmented construction data into a "Single Source of Truth," enabling Project Coordinators to monitor multi-million dollar budgets, track document compliance, and manage project lifecycles with precision.
