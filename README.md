📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a Project Controls & Operational Dashboard designed for a global professional services environment (e.g., Turner & Townsend). It integrates fragmented construction data into a unified visual narrative to enhance decision-making in project delivery, cost management, and document compliance.

The dashboard addresses the core responsibilities of a Project Coordinator: tracking financial P&L, monitoring document approval workflows (Document Control), and ensuring project milestones are met across diverse sectors (Infrastructure, Real Estate, Energy).

🚀 Key Features & Analytics
1. Financial Performance (Budget vs. Actual)
Metric: Baseline Budget vs. Actual Expenditure.

Visual: Bullet Graphs with color-coded Budget Health Status.

Insight: Identified cost variances and budget utilization rates to trigger immediate financial reconciliation for over-budget projects.

2. Document Control Matrix (Compliance)
Metric: Approval Rates for RFIs, Invoices, Submittals, and Contracts.

Visual: Heatmap highlighting approval bottlenecks.

Insight: Streamlined the "smooth information flow" by pinpointing specific document types causing delays in the project lifecycle.

3. Lifecycle Progression Tracking
Metric: Project Stages (Pre-construction, Construction, Close-out).

Visual: Interactive progress markers scaled by budget intensity.

Insight: Optimized resource allocation by prioritizing projects in the critical 'Close-out' phase.

🛠 Tech Stack
Data Generation: Python (Pandas, Numpy) to simulate complex construction datasets.

Data Visualization: Tableau (Tableau Story utilized for weekly progress reporting).

Analysis: Calculated Fields (Financial Variance, Compliance %), Data Modeling (1-to-Many Relationships).

📁 Project Structure
data/: Contains simulated CSV files (tt_project_master.csv, tt_document_logs.csv).

images/: High-resolution screenshots of the Dashboard and Story points.

tableau/: The packaged Tableau Workbook (.twbx) for interactive review.

reports/: Exported PDF of the Weekly Project Progress Report.

📊 Business Impact
Enhanced Visibility: Replaced manual Excel tracking with a real-time automated "Single Source of Truth."

Risk Mitigation: Developed a proactive "Watchlist" to intervene in high-risk projects before budget overruns occur.

Efficiency: Reduced reporting turnaround time by automating financial calculations and compliance monitoring.
